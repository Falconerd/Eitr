# Eitr

## Description

Everything in this mod revolves around using a substance known as Eitr in
various ways.

## Planned Features

> This mod is initially trying to provide similar quality of life improvements
> as seen in many other mods. Over time, more unique elements will be added in
> as my Minecraft modding experience increases.

### Ore Doubling

The ore doubling mechanic is quite involved, but can be fully automated.

Ore is put into a Blast Furnace and melted into a molten form. This molten ore
is then transported via pipes into an Eitr Infusement Chamber.

The Eitr Infusion Chamber must have a supply of Eitr to infuse the molten ore
with. Once the process is completed, the output of this machine will be double
what is put in, minus the required Eitr.

The molten ore can then be piped into a Heated Tank for storage and to create
Alloys, or it can be piped into the Heavy Press.

The Heavy Press can be fitted with a range of moulds. It can be fitted with two
moulds at a time. One of these moulds is the Ingot Mould.

The molten ore will be processed by this machine and then output as Ingots!

### Alloying

Alloying is achieved by combining molten metals inside a Heated Tank. For
instance, combining Molten Copper and Molten Zinc will produce Molten Brass.

The molten alloy can then be piped into a Heavy Press to be turned into ingots
or other parts, depending on the fitted moulds.

### Pipes

The fluid pipes supplied in this mod do not follow the standard pattern of each
pipe block containing some fluid. Instead, if a pipe network contains two or
more fluid inventories and at least one input and one output is configured, the
fluid will be removed from the blocks connected to the output and transferred
into the connected blocks.

### Increased Crop Growth Rate

### Eitr Infused Tools

### Eitr Infused Armour
