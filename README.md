# Eitr

## Description

Everything in this mod revolves around using a substance known as Eitr in
various ways.

## Planned Features

> This mod is initially trying to provide similar quality of life improvements
> as seen in many other mods. Over time, more unique elements will be added in
> as my Minecraft modding experience increases.

### Ore Processing

The ore processing pipeline in Eitr is used to double ores, create alloys and
use Enriched Molten Ore to create things.

### Alloying

Alloying is achieved by combining molten metals inside a Heated Tank. For
instance, combining Molten Copper and Molten Zinc will produce Molten Brass.

### Pipes

The fluid pipes supplied in this mod do not follow the standard pattern of each
pipe block containing some fluid. Instead, if a pipe network contains two or
more fluid inventories and at least one input and one output is configured, the
fluid will be removed from the blocks connected to the output and transferred
into the connected blocks.
